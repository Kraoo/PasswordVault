### Password Vault

## Overview
A project in C++ to store your passwords to your computer but instead of just doing it in the terminal I am using sdl to try to create a GUI where you can log in and from there see any of the information you have stored on there. Not much for practicality with this project but trying to get better sdl mainly. As of now this project is very very far from complete, the screen is just black right now when loaded.
